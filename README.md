Project Brief: Flood Prediction Algorithm for Emilia-Romagna

https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/erfloodprevention/assets/romagna_italy


Objective:
Develop a machine learning algorithm to predict flood events in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, enhancing early warning systems and improving disaster preparedness.

Key Components:

1. Data Collection:
   - Historical flood data for Emilia-Romagna
   - Meteorological data (rainfall, temperature, humidity)
   - Hydrological data (river levels, soil moisture)
   - Topographical data (elevation, land use)
   - Hydrometric level of rivers
   - Satellite imagery

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean and normalize data
   - Handle missing values
   - Feature engineering

3. Algorithm Development:
   - Explore various ML models (e.g., Random Forests, Neural Networks, LSTM)
   - Train models on historical data
   - Implement time-series analysis for temporal patterns

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Use cross-validation techniques
   - Evaluate using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Compare performance against existing flood prediction methods

5. Integration with GIS:
   - Incorporate geographical information systems for spatial analysis
   - Develop flood risk maps

6. Real-time Data Integration:
   - Design system to incorporate real-time weather and hydrological data

7. User Interface:
   - Create a dashboard for visualizing predictions and risk levels

8. Validation and Testing:
   - Conduct thorough testing with recent flood events
   - Collaborate with local authorities for real-world validation

Expected Outcomes:
- Accurate flood prediction model for Emilia-Romagna
- Improved lead time for flood warnings
- Enhanced decision-making tools for emergency management
